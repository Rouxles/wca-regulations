# Addition of a new event

Not necessarily complete list of criteria:

- Community Interest
- Practicality
- Consistent with the [spirit and mission of the WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/about), as well as [Regulation 9a](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9a) (though any of these _could_  change).
- Interesting to solve and watch (from [Sarah](http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?47301-The-quot-Why-I-hate-this-event-quot-and-quot-Why-this-event-should-be-added-quot-thread&p=974947&viewfull=1#post974947))
- A unique challenge compared to other events
- Having a reliable scrambler state generator

See the addition of Skewb for an example ([#159](../issues/159), [#102](../issues/102)).
